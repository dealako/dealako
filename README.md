### Hello, I'm David Deal ðŸ‘‹

#### Background

I'm a Senior Engineering Manager for The Linux Foundation, directing the LFX platform services team.  My primary role is a technical lead where I design/architect, implement, test/validate, deploy, and support the complete cradle-to-grave product design through production operations.  I manage a team of 6-10 distributed multi-cultural engineers who support the products ranging from front-end developers to backend developers, design, quality assurance/testing, and documentation.  My job duties involve interacting with internal and external stakeholders, performing demonstrations, interacting with vendors, and building large-scale integrations.

#### ðŸ”­ Current Projects

Some of my current tasks include:

- managing internal data sources and integrations with external systems, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, GitHub, and DocuSign.
- capturing product requirements and building solutions. Specifically, I'm working to finalize a multi-step DocuSign flow that integrates webhook notifications so that our membership status is updated to support our reporting requirements.
- working on new onboarding automation workflows. This includes executing new workflows when events occur in our system (such as adding users to Slack, adding users to specific committees, and sending LFX platform invitations).

#### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

Historically, I've been a long-time backend Java developer. Within the past 4-5 years, I've picked up Golang and have used it extensively in the LFx Security and LFx EasyCLA products.  More recently:

- I've started revisiting/relearning how neural networks (NN) and artificial intelligence (AI). Previously in my career, I was exposed to and supported a NN project. I was always super curious, but never got the opportunity to dive in deep. I'm now re-learning some of the core concepts by taking some Udemy training and reading the Deep Learning Illustrated book by Jon Krohn.
- I'm tracking the progress of Rust. I find the memory delegation model fascinating.
- I continue to use/leverage Python. You can never know enough Python IHO ðŸ§ .
- Streamline our functional API testing using Cypress
- As a long-time Jetbrains IntelliJ user, I'm still playing with VScode, especially the new Insiders edition with build-in ChatGPT :-)

#### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about

- Living in San Diego
- Soccer/Football
- Electric Cars, Solar tech, renewable energy (I'm interested in the tech aspect of it)

#### âš¡ Fun fact

I served six years in the US Navy as a crypto technician. I later transitioned to developing software (after working and going to school at night to get my degree) when the electronics job became "plug-and-play".
