### Hello, I'm David Deal ðŸ‘‹

#### Background

I'm the Senior Director of Engineering for The Linux Foundation, responsible for managing Engineers, Contractors, LFX platform services, integrations, and overall execution.  My primary role is a director/manager/technical lead, where I design/architect, implement, test/validate, deploy, and support the complete cradle-to-grave product design through production operations, all while supporting the engineering teams.  Additionally, I support the CTO office by driving execution for our various AI initiatives. I directly and indirectly manage a team of 60+ distributed multi-cultural engineers who support the products, ranging from front-end developers to backend developers, design, quality assurance/testing, and documentation.  My job duties involve interacting with internal and external stakeholders, performing demonstrations, interacting with vendors, and building large-scale integrations.

#### ðŸ”­ Current Projects

Some of my current tasks include:

- AI team and product innovation. I work with vendors, engineers, leadership, and open source tools to enable our engineers and product to leverage AI technologies. We are mandated to optimize and automate our workflow and engineering capabilities for 2025 and beyond.
- Datalake Product Lead - after successfully transitioning a legacy datalake to Snowflake, I now lead a team responsible for managing the datalake for The Linux Foundation. We have many internal and external customers leveraging the data models, a wildly diverse set of external systems, and numerous downstream consumers who rely on our data analytics products.
- managing internal data sources and integrations with external systems, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, GitHub, Snowflake (Data Warehouse), Cision/Brandwatch/Google Analytics (Marketing Analytics), Cvent (Events), Sessionize (Speaker Proposals), and DocuSign (Contract/Legal).
- Capturing product requirements and building solutions. Duties cover BizOps, CloudOps, Support, IT, and Products/Services.
- Working on new onboarding automation workflows. This includes executing new workflows when events occur in our system (such as adding users to Slack, adding users to specific committees, and sending LFX platform invitations).

#### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

Historically, I've been a long-time backend Java developer. Within the past 5-6 years, I've picked up Golang and have used it extensively across all the Linux Foundation tools and products.  More recently:

- Leverage AI in all aspects, both personal and work. This year has seen a significant growth in AI agents, models, and capabilities. Staying on top of the latest trends has been challenging - we're all in this journey together. Using this technology is shifting our focus from remedial low-level tasks to higher-level, critical thinking activities. 
- I've started revisiting/relearning how neural networks (NN) and artificial intelligence (AI). Previously, in my career, I was exposed to and supported an NN project. I was always super curious, but never got to dive in deep. I'm now re-learning some of the core concepts by taking some Udemy training and reading the Deep Learning Illustrated book by Jon Krohn.
- I'm also learning (re-learning) more about the current Data Engineering trends, building out layers of data models to support (re-)usability/composition and testing, all to support constantly evolving business specifications.
- I'm tracking Rust's progress. I find the language interesting - especially the memory delegation model.
- I continue to use/leverage Python. You can never know enough Python, IMHO ðŸ§ .
- Streamline our functional API testing using Cypress automation testing (as part of our CI/CD pipelines)

#### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about

- Living in San Diego
- Soccer/Football
- Electric Cars, Solar tech, renewable energy (I'm interested in the tech aspect of it)

#### âš¡ Fun fact

I served six years in the US Navy as a crypto technician. I later transitioned to developing software (after working and attending school at night to get my degree) when the electronics job became "plug-and-play."
