### Hello, I'm David Deal ðŸ‘‹

#### Background

I'm a Senior Engineering Manager for The Linux Foundation where I support the [LFx Security](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) and LFx EasyCLA products.  My primary role is a technical lead for both projects where I design/architect, implement, test/validate, deploy, and support the complete cradle to grave product design through production operations.  I manage a team of 6-10 distributed multi-cultural engineers who support the products ranging from front-end developers, backend developers, design, quality assurance/testing, and documentation.  My job duties require interaction with internal and external stakeholders, performing demonstrations, interacting with vendors, and building large-scale integrations.

#### ðŸ”­ Current Projects

Some of my current tasks include:

- transitioning LFX Security from an architecture where the product collects, manages, and shares vulnerability, code secret, non-inclusive language, criticality scores, security rankings data to a larger datalake construct where the product and APIs interact with the larger global platform (called LFx).
- building and scaling out the LFx Security APIs to support the growing demand/usage of the product
- migrating a number of our internal repositories which include data schemas, data publishers, frontend, middle-tier, and other API components to a public open-source model 

#### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

Historically, I've been a long-time backend Java developer. Within the past 4-5 years, I've picked up Golang and have used it extensively in the LFx Security and LFx EasyCLA products.  More recently:

- I've started revisiting/relearning Javascript/Typescript/NodeJS as internally we used these technologies in many places.
- I'm learning a bit about Rust
- I continue to use/leverage Python
- Streamline our functional testing using Postman
- As a long-time Jetbrains IntelliJ user, I like trying out and testing VSCode - especially since it's open-source :-)

#### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about

- Living in San Diego
- Soccer/Football
- Electric Cars, Solar tech, renewable energy (I'm interested in the tech aspect of it)

#### âš¡ Fun fact

I served six years in the US Navy as a crypto technician but transitioned to developing software (after working and going to school at night to get my degree) when the electronics job became "boring".
